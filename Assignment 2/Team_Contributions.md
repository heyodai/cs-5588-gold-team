## Team: Game Stop 

# Team Members and their contributions 
1. Odai - ML Engineer - https://github.com/heyodai

   Helped with alot of the intial planning and direction that the model should go in. Brought a ton of ideas over tech that could be used in order to give us a great product. Exceled in getting our models results into a front end and taking our results from just a notebook to an actual UI that a user could finally look at and interact with 
3. Semir - Team Leader - https://github.com/SemirHot

   Worked with Devin in establishing the intial GNN that gave us the first set of results and an direction to go in. Data discovery and research over pulling in data from yfinance api and knowing what things are avaible from that API to be pulled in. Most presentation docs for this mile stone. Intial base html page that will be built off and made better.
5. Nami - Financial Analyst - https://github.com/Nami1217
   -
   Advised the team on the data that can be used and is working hard in finding us a good reliable source of data from the text data that we really need to boost this model to the next level. More over advising the team in some other directions that we could take to establish an even better model by using a knowlage graph that is fed into the GNN
7. Devin - Product Architect - https://github.com/devin-cline
   -
   Explored alternate preprocessing steps and modeling through the use of a temporal GNN. This approach promised great performance in in handeling time series data. Worked though a ton of issues and data preprocessing in order to have a df that can be taken though a temporal GNN.

   My team has been working very well together, I feel like we're all meshing really well and giving each other a whole bunch of ideas that otherwise we wouldn't have came up with. there's a lot of work to be done still in order to integrate all the technologies, but I feel like with this team we will be able to do that without a problem. If I had to give criticism I feel like if we could have a few more meetings throughout the week just establish where we're at would be nice.
   I feel like I have been working really well with the team and have been doing what they have asked of me, I feel like I am doing well in the project so far and am learning a ton about the financal world.

   Everything has been great so far, I'm more of a fan of establishing what is needed from the beginning and working to that throughout the semester instead of having to meet 100 multiple times to get on the same page. we have a great team that has a diverse background and machine learning, and that really allows us to utilize every group member and every single portion of this. I'm happy with the direction that we're going.
   Personally I feel like I am doing really well and learning alot of new things as I am going. Even with the hands on things that we do on a weekly basis i am really loving! This team project and class is really pushing me to be better and work hard to soak up everything i can.

   Team has been really great to work with so far, having worked with Devon and Odai in the past it was really simple to just pick up where we left off, not literally this is a different project but figuratively. we have a great sense of direction but we have to make sure we stay on top of it in order to fulfill our promises on this massive undertaking.
   I am working hard in order to ensure that we are meeting the goals and the team is working well together, meaning, making it clear what we want and where we are going, I think I am doing a good job so far being involved with the team and making my self present in all things regarding the project, I would like to dive a bit more into the model and keep working on that but other then I feel like I am doing great so far and learning a ton.

   i've enjoyed my time with the group and everyone in it, it took us a little bit in order to figure out exactly what direction we wanted to go in, but once we figured out, we were all able to work together pretty well in order to accomplish that first milestone of the project. There's a lot of work left to do not a ton of time so as a group, we're gonna have to ensure that we're on top of it.
   I have had a great time working on this project, The team has been great like i said before and it has been really easy to become a key player on the team and grow my skills. I feel like I have done a great job with all the tasks that have been asked of me and entrsuted to me.
