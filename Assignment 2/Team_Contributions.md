# Team Members and their contributions 
1. Odai - ML Engineer - https://github.com/heyodai
   -
   Helped with alot of the intial planning and direction that the model should go in. Brought a ton of ideas over tech that could be used in order to give us a great product. Exceled in getting our models results into a front end and taking our results from just a notebook to an actual UI that a user could finally look at and interact with 
3. Semir - Team Leader - https://github.com/SemirHot

   Worked with Devin in establishing the intial GNN that gave us the first set of results and an direction to go in. Data discovery and research over pulling in data from yfinance api and knowing what things are avaible from that API to be pulled in. Most presentation docs for this mile stone. Intial base html page that will be built off and made better.
5. Nami - Financial Analyst - https://github.com/Nami1217
   -
   Advised the team on the data that can be used and is working hard in finding us a good reliable source of data from the text data that we really need to boost this model to the next level. More over advising the team in some other directions that we could take to establish an even better model by using a knowlage graph that is fed into the GNN
7. Devin - Product Architect - https://github.com/devin-cline

   Explored alternate preprocessing steps and modeling through the use of a temporal GNN. This approach promised great performance in in handeling time series data. Worked though a ton of issues and data preprocessing in order to have a df that can be taken though a temporal GNN.
